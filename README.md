Hello! 

This is the gerber files for a distortion guitar pedal. The sound is quite similar to [Ibane TS9](https://www.thomann.de/gr/ibanez_ts9_tube_screamer.htm). The files are production ready, I personally used this [site](https://jlcpcb.com/) for ordering the pcbs.


A top view of the PCB looks like this.
